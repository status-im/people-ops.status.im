We encourage the use of working hours for learning related to your work and our collective mission. It's important that your team is aware of you being on/offline and that progress of the team doesn't get hindered by it, so make sure to discuss it openly and reach an agreement on timing with everyone involved.

Not sure how long to spend on learning? As an example, a full-time contributor could spend their first 1-4 weeks spending 10-20 hours p/w to learn, and ~2-5 hours p/w after that on an ongoing basis. This is just an example, and we encourage you to figure out a learning cadence that best helps you succeed in your contributing to Status.
