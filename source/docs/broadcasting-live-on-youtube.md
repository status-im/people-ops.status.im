Here's how to set up a live feed to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Statusim). You might also consider using [Livepeer](https://people-ops.status.im/broadcasting-on-livepeer/) in tandem.

### In advance of the event

1.  Add the event to the [Status Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=c3RhdHVzLmltX2dlMGd0MGw5ajI3NjNhZ2lkYWo2dTM2b2FrQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) so it's accessible, adding the YouTube Live [address](https://www.youtube.com/c/Statusim/live) in the invite. If you want all Status core contributors to be notified, send out the invite to <status-all@status.im>.
2.  Ping [@ceri](status-im://user/0x048cf942082726d25dbfc7fae43436388df5c9a8af0987a91cef5fe9928beff3c52c34f98212e4bcd983ba3e1ae0e03fc05c7ced6a43ddc8814187d4856502c1ca), [@rajanie](status-im://user/0x04aca623746382b59a7bdce5e7ef93b3fe7eb30af7a0f246cafc22bd59b9d1de540d01d512cd1636a7f1e8250a8fbc85880a158afbf96f65d089610c8ec0074f83) or [@jonny](status-im://user/0x04f05d31956e9c918c35c30defe1ab69bc693d27eb3f79d619c3ba4f9f044b2349a79fb38e3a614ce9af1286910aa19bf24b53c18d48e10657cbf615a380928f6e) and request the Zoom company account login credentials, and for your YouTube access to be upgraded to `Manager`. Accept the YouTube and LastPass invites you receive.
3.  In the company Zoom account (username: `rajanie@status.im`), schedule a `Webinar` (NB: `Meetings` cannot be broadcast so don't choose that option), checking the time zone and date are accurate. Configure the webinar to your preference. We recommend:

-   Registration NOT required
-   Video - Host ON / Panelist ON
-   Audio - Both
-   Webinar password NOT required
-   Q&A - ON
-   Webinar Options - Select `Record Webinar Automatically` > `In the cloud`

### 15 minutes prior to the event

1.  Log in to Zoom using the company credentials. Navigate to `My Webinars`, then click `Start`next to your chosen event.

2\. If you'd like participants to be able to talk in the Zoom, be sure to promote them from `Attendees`(listen only) to `Panelists`, by clicking `More` > `Promote to Panelist`. If you have a co-presenter, they should arrive early, as you may find you're unable to leave your slides once presenting live to upgrade their status to Panelist. You can also right click on their name and make them a `Co-Host`, allowing them to help you manage participants if you're busy presenting.

3\. Test the YouTube live feed:

Step 1: In the bottom panel, you will see `... More`. Click that >> select `Live on YouTube`

Step 2: You will be presented with a window to `Choose a Google Account`. Select the `Status`account, choosing the `Private` option >> `Go Live`

Step 3: You will now be broadcasting live in a private stream, meaning that it's not visible to the public. You can end the test stream by clicking in the top left of the Zoom webinar window on `Live on YouTube` >> `Stop Live Stream`

### 5 minutes prior to the event

1.  Ping in [#status](https://get.status.im/chat/public/status) that you will begin your talk in 5 minutes. Include a link to the YT channel, e.g.:

> Hi folks! I'll be hosting a hangout on `topic` in 5 minutes. Join me over at: https://www.youtube.com/c/Statusim/live

2\. Pull up your slides (if using) by choosing the `Share` option in the bottom navigation.

### Go live

1.  Follow the same steps above that you used to test the live stream, but select `Public` rather than `Private` under Privacy when setting up the Zoom broadcast
2.  The live YouTube page should pop up in a browser. Mute it as there is a ~15 second delay which causes an echo if you're both presenting live and listening to the feed.

### Ending the webinar

1.  Click in the top left of the Zoom webinar window on `Live on YouTube` >> `Stop Live Stream`
2.  Click `End the Meeting` > `End the Meeting for All` in the Zoom window.

### After the event

1.  If you're happy for the raw recording to stay as it is on the YouTube channel, no further action required. If you'd like to add a thumbnail, or include the video in a playlist, ping @ceri/@rajanie/@jonny for help.
2.  If you need a recording, you can retrieve it from the Zoom account via `My Account` >> `My Recordings`

FAQs
----

### Why Zoom?

Zoom allows us to host webinars with up to 100 viewers as well as broadcast the session to YouTube.

### Can I use my own Zoom account?

Our subscription level only allows for one individual account to have live broadcast functionality enabled, and it is this one, so please don't use your own account.

### Can I keep my YouTube manager access after my talk?

You'll be using the official Status account. For security, we will revoke access after the talk, unless you need frequent/ongoing access - please request from @ceri/@rajanie/@jonny.

### Where can I get help on the day?

Ping @ceri/@rajanie/@jonny for support & troubleshooting.

### What are some things I should check when aiming for the best quality broadcast?

-   Allow plenty of time to set up the YouTube feed and get ready, it can be fiddly and take longer than anticipated
-   Practice speaking slowly and clearly so viewers with different levels of technical knowledge or non-native speakers can follow along easily.
-   Find a quiet space without much background noise.
-   Check your mic for clarity - ping a fellow team member on a test Zoom meeting to check your mic sound quality.
-   Check for any pop-up notifications that may interfere with your broadcast and switch them off if necessary.

### How do I do Q&A with attendees in the Zoom window?

If making time for Q&A in the session, scan for comments in the YouTube feed or in the Zoom chat window/participants list.

`Attendees` in your Zoom who are not Panelists can't unmute themselves on demand, they can "raise a hand" to show you that they want to talk. It's up to you to unmute them to allow them to ask a question.

Note that the questions in YouTube will be delayed due to the lag between Zoom/YouTube live. You may want to mention this and give folks a bit of additional time (we've seen questions typically come in just as the presenter is about to close the session) :)
